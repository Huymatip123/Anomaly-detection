## 1. What Is This Project?

This project builds a **real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**. In plain English:

> Every time data travels across a network, it creates "traffic." Some of that traffic is normal (browsing the web, watching a video). Some of it is malicious — someone trying to break into a server, flood it with garbage data, or steal information. Our system watches this traffic and flags the bad stuff automatically.

The project has two main parts:

| Part | What It Does | Where It Runs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Training** | Teaches a computer to recognize 10 types of network attacks using a labeled dataset | Google Colab / your laptop |
| **Deployment** | Takes the trained model and uses it on live network traffic to make real-time predictions | A server with FastAPI |

Think of Part 1 as going to school and Part 2 as starting the job.

## 2. The Dataset: CIC-UNSW-NB15

Machine learning needs examples. We don't have real attack data lying around, so we use a public, academic dataset called **CIC-UNSW-NB15** created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity at the University of New Brunswick (UNB) [1].

### 2.1 What Is a "Network Flow"?

A **network flow** is the record of a conversation between two computers on a network.

Imagine Computer A sends a request to Computer B. The conversation might be:

1. A sends 3 packets to B (total 1,200 bytes)
2. B sends 2 packets back to A (total 800 bytes)
3. The whole thing takes 0.5 seconds
4. They use the TCP protocol on port 80 (HTTP)

A flow is exactly this: a summary of that conversation. It does **not** contain the actual content of the messages (no passwords, no credit card numbers). It only contains **statistics** about the conversation.

### 2.2 What Is CICFlowMeter?

CICFlowMeter [2] is a tool developed by UNB that:

1. Reads raw network traffic (a `.pcap` file — think of it as an audio recording of network traffic)
2. Groups packets into flows (by matching source IP, destination IP, ports, and protocol)
3. Computes **84 statistical features** for each flow

These features include things like:

| Feature Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Duration** | How long the flow lasted (seconds) |
| **Packet count** | Number of packets sent forward and backward |
| **Byte count** | Total bytes sent forward and backward |
| **Packet length** | Min, max, mean, std of packet sizes |
| **Packet inter-arrival time** | Time gaps between packets (min, max, mean, std) |
| **Flags** | TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, etc.) |
| **Idle / Active** | How long the flow was idle vs active |

All 84 features are **numerical** — no text, no images, no sequences of requests. Each flow becomes one row of numbers. This is called **tabular data** (like a spreadsheet).

### 2.3 Dataset Statistics

The CIC-UNSW-NB15 dataset is built on top of the original UNSW-NB15 [3] dataset. The original dataset was created in 2015 at the Australian Centre for Cyber Security using a tool called IXIA PerfectStorm to generate realistic normal and attack traffic. The raw packets (100 GB of `.pcap` files) were then processed through CICFlowMeter to produce the final CSV files.

| Category | Original UNSW-NB15 | CICFlowMeter Extraction | CIC-UNSW-NB15 (Final) |
|----------|------------------:|------------------------:|----------------------:|
| Benign | 2,218,764 | 3,450,658 | **358,332** |
| Analysis | 2,677 | 385 | **385** |
| Backdoor | 2,329 | 452 | **452** |
| DoS | 16,353 | 4,467 | **4,467** |
| Exploits | 44,525 | 30,951 | **30,951** |
| Fuzzers | 24,246 | 29,613 | **29,613** |
| Generic | 215,481 | 4,632 | **4,632** |
| Reconnaissance | 13,987 | 16,735 | **16,735** |
| Shellcode | 1,511 | 2,102 | **2,102** |
| Worms | 174 | 246 | **246** |
| **Total** | ~2.5M | ~3.5M | **~448,000** |

The final dataset has about **448,000 flows** with an 80:20 ratio of benign to malicious traffic (to reflect real-world conditions where most traffic is normal).

### 2.4 Attack Categories (10 Classes)

| # | Name | What It Means (Simple Explanation) | Real-World Example |
|---|------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | **Benign** | Normal, safe traffic | Opening google.com |
| 1 | **Analysis** | Attackers probe the system to understand its weaknesses (port scanning, vulnerability scanning) | Sending carefully crafted requests to see how the server responds |
| 2 | **Backdoor** | A hidden entry point that bypasses normal authentication | Software that lets the attacker log in without a password |
| 3 | **DoS** (Denial of Service) | Flooding a server with traffic so it can't serve real users | Millions of fake requests that make a website crash |
| 4 | **Exploits** | Taking advantage of a software bug to gain control | Sending a carefully formatted message that crashes the program and runs attacker's code |
| 5 | **Fuzzers** | Sending random, malformed data to find bugs | Sending garbage input to see if the application breaks |
| 6 | **Generic** | Attacks against encryption systems (cryptography) | Trying to break a hashing algorithm |
| 7 | **Reconnaissance** | Gathering information about the target before an attack | Finding out what software versions the server runs |
| 8 | **Shellcode** | Small piece of code injected into a running program to take control | Like Exploits but specifically about injecting executable code |
| 9 | **Worms** | Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically | A virus that copies itself to other computers without human help |

### 2.5 Why This Dataset?

There are older datasets for intrusion detection:

| Dataset | Year | Flows | Classes | Problems |
|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| KDD99 | 1999 | ~5M | 5 | 25+ years old, does not represent modern traffic |
| NSL-KDD | 2009 | ~150K | 5 | Reduced version of KDD99, still outdated |
| CIC-IDS2017 | 2017 | ~2.8M | 15 | Good but very large, complex preprocessing |
| **CIC-UNSW-NB15** | **2024** | **~448K** | **10** | **Modern traffic, well-balanced size, clean preprocessing, recent** |

We chose **CIC-UNSW-NB15** because:
- **Modern**: Traffic generated in 2015, features re-extracted in 2024 with CICFlowMeter
- **Size**: 448K flows is large enough to train good models but small enough to run on a laptop
- **Classes**: 10 categories cover a wide range of real attack types
- **Clean**: Comes pre-processed with `Data.csv` + `Label.csv` (80:20 ratio)
- **Recent citation**: Published with a 2024 paper [4], making it academically current

### 3.3 How the Two Pipelines Connect

The key insight is that **both pipelines process the same 84 features in the same format**:

- **During training**: We use the pre-computed CSV from CIC-UNSW-NB15. The model learns patterns: "If feature X is high and feature Y is low, it's probably a DoS attack."
- **During deployment**: We use CICFlowMeter on live traffic to compute the **same 84 features**. The same model then applies what it learned.

This is why choosing CICFlowMeter as the feature extractor is important — it ensures the training data and the live data are in the same "language."

## 4. Data Preprocessing

### 4.1 Why Do We Need Preprocessing?

Raw data is messy. Think of it like cooking: you don't just throw unwashed vegetables into a pot. You clean, peel, and chop them first. Preprocessing is the same for data.

Raw CSV files may have:
- **Missing values**: Some cells are empty (NaN = "Not a Number")
- **Infinity**: Some calculations produce numbers too large to store (Inf)
- **Categorical text**: Columns like "protocol = TCP" that need to be converted to numbers
- **Different scales**: One feature ranges from 0 to 1, another from 0 to 1,000,000
- **Uneven classes**: 80% of data is "Benign," only 0.05% is "Worms"

If we skip preprocessing, the model either fails to train or learns incorrect patterns.

### 4.2 Handling Missing Values and Infinity

Machine learning models cannot process NaN or Inf values. They simply crash.

| Problem | Why It Happens | What We Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| NaN | Division by zero, missing sensor data | Replace with column mean (mean imputation) |
| Inf | Very large numbers from packet timing | Replace with column max |
| Negative values where not expected | Data errors | Cap at 0 or investigate |

**Code logic**: Scan every column. If NaN → fill with mean of that column. If Inf → replace with max finite value. If all values are NaN (useless column) → drop the column entirely.

### 4.3 Categorical Features

Some columns contain text, not numbers:

```
proto: TCP, UDP, ICMP, ...
state: FIN, CON, RST, ...
service: HTTP, DNS, FTP, ...
```

A model can only multiply numbers, not compare strings. We need to convert text to numbers.

**Two approaches**:

| Method | What It Does | Analogy | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Label Encoding** | Assigns each category a number: TCP → 0, UDP → 1, ICMP → 2 | Giving each student a student ID | Works for tree models (XGBoost) |
| **One-Hot Encoding** | Creates a new column for each category: `is_TCP` (0/1), `is_UDP` (0/1), `is_ICMP` (0/1) | Multiple choice: pick one option | Required for neural networks (MLP) |

**Our choice**: Use **Label Encoding** for XGBoost (trees handle ordinal encoding naturally). Use **One-Hot Encoding** for MLP (neural networks need binary inputs).

**Important**: We must save the encoding mapping during training and reuse it during deployment. If the training data has TCP → 0, UDP → 1, then live data must use the same mapping.

### 4.4 Feature Scaling

Look at two features from the dataset:

| Feature | Typical Range |
|---------|-------------|
| Flow Duration | 0 – 10,000,000 (microseconds) |
| Fwd Packets/s | 0 – 1,000 |

The duration feature is **10,000x larger** than the packets-per-second feature. 

- **For tree models (XGBoost)**: This does not matter. Trees make decisions by comparing values ("is duration > 500?") regardless of scale. **No scaling needed.**
- **For neural networks (MLP)**: This matters a lot. Neural networks use gradient descent, which works best when all features are roughly the same scale (usually 0 to 1 or -1 to 1). Without scaling, the duration feature dominates the learning process. **Scaling is required.**

**Standard Scaling (Z-score)**: `x_new = (x - mean) / standard_deviation`

This transforms each feature so its mean is 0 and its standard deviation is 1. All features now live in approximately the same range.

**Important**: Compute the mean and std from the **training set only**. Apply the same transformation to validation and test sets. Never use test set statistics — that would be "cheating" (data leakage).

### 4.5 Handling Class Imbalance

Look at the class distribution again:

```
Benign:       358,332 (80.0%)
Exploits:      30,951 (6.9%)
Fuzzers:       29,613 (6.6%)
Reconnaissance: 16,735 (3.7%)
Generic:        4,632 (1.0%)
DoS:            4,467 (1.0%)
Shellcode:      2,102 (0.5%)
Backdoor:         452 (0.1%)
Analysis:         385 (0.1%)
Worms:            246 (0.05%)
```

This is called **class imbalance**. If we train a model on this raw data, it will learn to predict "Benign" for everything and still be 80% accurate. But it would completely miss Worms, Backdoor, and Analysis attacks.

**Why this happens**: The model optimizes for overall accuracy. Ignoring rare classes barely hurts the average accuracy, so the model "takes the easy way out."

**Solutions**:

| Solution | How It Works | Our Plan |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **class_weight** | Tell the model: "Making a mistake on Worms costs 100x more than making a mistake on Benign" | ✅ Used for XGBoost (built-in) |
| **Oversampling (SMOTE)** | Create synthetic copies of rare classes by interpolating between existing examples | ✅ Used for MLP |
| **Undersampling** | Remove random samples from the majority class | ❌ We lose too much data |
| **Stratified Split** | Ensure each train/val/test set has the same class proportions as the original | ✅ Always used |

**What is SMOTE?** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

SMOTE creates new "fake" examples of rare classes. It works by:
1. Pick a rare-class example
2. Find its nearest neighbors of the same class
3. Draw a line between the example and its neighbor
4. Place a new point somewhere on that line

This gives the model more examples of rare classes to learn from, without simply duplicating existing data (which causes overfitting).

### 4.6 Train / Validation / Test Split

We split the data into three parts:

| Set | % of Data | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| **Training** | 70% | The model learns from this data. It sees these examples and adjusts its parameters. |
| **Validation** | 15% | We use this to tune hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, learning rate) and decide when to stop training. The model does NOT learn from this. |
| **Test** | 15% | We evaluate the final model here. This data is completely unseen until the very end. It simulates how the model will perform on real, new data. |

**Why not 100% training?** If you test on the same data you trained on, you get 100% accuracy — but the model just memorized the answers (overfitting). It will fail on real data. The validation and test sets are "honest" evaluations.

**Stratified Split**: Each of the three sets preserves the same class proportions. If the full dataset is 80% Benign, then training is 80% Benign, validation is 80% Benign, and test is 80% Benign. This prevents the test set from (by random chance) containing no Worms examples.

## 5. Machine Learning Models

### 5.1 XGBoost (Primary Model)

#### 5.1.1 What Is XGBoost?

XGBoost stands for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**. Let's break that down:

- **Decision Tree**: A flowchart. "Is feature A > 5? If yes → go left, if no → go right." Each final leaf contains a prediction.
- **Boosting**: Instead of building one perfect tree, build many small, weak trees in sequence. Each new tree focuses on fixing the mistakes of all previous trees combined.
- **Gradient**: The "mistakes" are measured using a mathematical function (gradient), which tells each new tree exactly which direction to improve.
- **Extreme**: Optimized for speed and performance (parallel processing, regularization).

Think of it like a group project:
1. Person 1 makes an initial guess (predict Benign for everything).
2. Person 2 looks at Person 1's mistakes and tries to correct them.
3. Person 3 looks at the combined output and corrects further.
4. ... continue for 500 iterations.
5. The final output is the sum of everyone's work.

#### 5.1.2 Why XGBoost?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Best-in-class for tabular data** | On spreadsheets of numbers, gradient-boosted trees consistently outperform neural networks [6] |
| **Handles missing values** | XGBoost learns the best "direction" when a value is missing — no need to pre-fill |
| **Feature importance** | XGBoost can tell us which features (e.g., "Packet Length Mean") are most useful for detecting attacks |
| **No scaling needed** | Tree models don't care about the scale of features |
| **Fast inference** | A single prediction takes microseconds — critical for real-time IDS |
| **Works on CPU** | No GPU required, runs on any laptop or server |

#### 5.1.3 Key Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are settings we choose **before** training (not learned by the model). Think of them as the settings on a cooking recipe:

| Parameter | What It Controls | Typical Range | Effect of Increasing |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| `n_estimators` | Number of trees in the ensemble | 100 – 1000 | More trees = better accuracy, but slower and risk of overfitting |
| `max_depth` | How deep each tree can grow | 3 – 10 | Deeper trees = more complex patterns, but overfitting |
| `learning_rate` | How much each new tree contributes | 0.01 – 0.3 | Smaller = more careful, better generalization, needs more trees |
| `subsample` | Fraction of data used per tree | 0.5 – 1.0 | Less = more randomness, reduces overfitting |
| `colsample_bytree` | Fraction of features used per tree | 0.5 – 1.0 | Less = more randomness, reduces overfitting |
| `scale_pos_weight` | How much to penalize mistakes on rare classes | Auto-calculated | Higher = more focus on rare classes (handles imbalance) |

**Tuning strategy**: We use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to try many combinations and pick the best based on validation F1-score.

#### 5.1.4 Multi-Class Output

XGBoost with `objective='multi:softprob'` outputs a **probability distribution** over all 10 classes:

```
{
  "Benign":         0.89,
  "Exploits":       0.05,
  "Fuzzers":        0.03,
  "Reconnaissance": 0.01,
  "DoS":            0.01,
  "Generic":        0.005,
  "Shellcode":      0.002,
  "Backdoor":       0.001,
  "Analysis":       0.001,
  "Worms":          0.000
}
```

The final prediction is the class with the highest probability (`argmax`).

### 5.2 Multi-Layer Perceptron (Deep Learning Baseline)

#### 5.2.1 What Is an MLP?

A **Multi-Layer Perceptron** is the simplest form of neural network. It is a mathematical function composed of layers:

```
Input (84 features)
    │
    ▼
Dense Layer 1 (256 neurons) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
    │
    ▼
Dense Layer 2 (128 neurons) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
    │
    ▼
Dense Layer 3 (10 neurons) → Softmax
    │
    ▼
Output (probabilities for 10 classes)
```

Each "Dense Layer" is a set of weights and biases. During training, the network adjusts these weights to minimize the error between its predictions and the true labels.

**Key components**:
- **Dense (Fully Connected)**: Every neuron connects to every neuron in the previous layer
- **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): An activation function that sets negative values to 0. `f(x) = max(0, x)`. It introduces non-linearity — without it, stacking layers would be mathematically equivalent to a single layer
- **Dropout**: During training, randomly "turn off" 30% of neurons. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron (regularization)
- **Softmax**: Converts raw scores into probabilities that sum to 1.0

#### 5.2.2 Why an MLP?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Baseline for deep learning** | If a simple MLP doesn't work well, a more complex architecture won't either |
| **Academic comparison** | Many papers use MLP as a baseline; we include it for completeness |
| **Different inductive bias** | Neural networks learn differently from trees — combining both in an ensemble may yield better results |
| **Can capture interactions** | MLPs can learn complex feature interactions that trees might miss |

#### 5.2.3 Training Details

MLPs require more care than XGBoost:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Feature scaling** | Without scaling, large-valued features dominate gradient updates |
| **GPU training** | Neural networks benefit massively from GPU parallelism |
| **More hyperparameters** | Learning rate, batch size, number of layers, layer sizes, dropout rate, optimizer choice |
| **Early stopping** | Stop training when validation loss stops improving (prevents overfitting) |

We train the MLP on **Google Colab** (free GPU) using PyTorch.

### 5.3 TabTransformer (Feature Interaction Model)

#### 5.3.1 What Is TabTransformer?

TabTransformer [9] is a neural network architecture designed specifically for **tabular data**. It uses a **Transformer Encoder** to learn rich feature interactions, then passes the result through a standard MLP head for classification.

The key insight is that we treat **each feature as a token** — just like a sentence is a sequence of words, a tabular row is a sequence of features. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism learns which features matter most when considered together.

```

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Feature Embedding**: Each of the 84 features is projected into a dense vector (e.g., 32 dimensions) via a learned linear layer. Continuous features are embedded directly; categorical features go through an embedding lookup table.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Since the Transformer is permutation-invariant (it doesn't know that "feature #1" comes before "feature #2"), we add a learnable position vector to each embedding. The position simply indicates the feature's index in the row.
3. **Transformer Encoder Layers**: The core of the model. Each layer has:
   - **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Every feature embedding looks at every other feature embedding and decides how much to "pay attention" to each one. If `flow_duration` and `fwd_packets_s` are highly correlated for DoS attacks, the attention weights between them will be high.
   - **Feed-Forward Network**: A small MLP that processes each feature's attended representation independently.
   - **Residual Connections + LayerNorm**: Help training stability (standard Transformer tricks).
4. **Pooling**: After N encoder layers, we collapse the sequence of 84 vectors into a single vector. Options:
   - **CLS token**: Add a special learnable token at position 0. After encoding, this token's representation serves as the aggregate.
   - **Mean pooling**: Average all 84 feature vectors.
5. **MLP Head**: A small MLP (e.g., 128 → 64 → 10) that converts the pooled vector into class probabilities.

#### 5.3.2 Why TabTransformer?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Learns feature interactions explicitly** | Self-attention directly models pairwise relationships between features. XGBoost can only learn interactions within tree depth limits. |
| **Handles both continuous and categorical** | Embedding layer automatically learns good representations for categorical features, unlike tree models that split on raw category IDs. |
| **Global context** | Each feature's representation is informed by ALL other features, not just a subset determined by tree structure. |
| **Proven on tabular data** | TabTransformer [9] and FT-Transformer [10] have shown competitive or superior performance vs gradient boosting on many tabular benchmarks. |
| **Complementary to XGBoost** | XGBoost excels at "local" patterns (threshold-based splits); Transformer excels at "global" feature interactions. Ensemble of both can outperform either alone. |

#### 5.3.3 Model Architecture (Our Configuration)

| Component | Setting |
|-----------|---------|
| Feature embedding dim | 32 |
| Number of Transformer layers | 3 – 6 |
| Attention heads | 4 – 8 |
| Feed-forward hidden dim | 128 – 256 |
| Dropout | 0.1 – 0.3 |
| Pooling | CLS token |
| MLP head | 128 → ReLU → Dropout → 64 → ReLU → 10 |

#### 5.3.4 Training Details

TabTransformer requires similar care to MLP:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Feature scaling** | Neural network — needs standardization |
| **GPU training** | Transformer layers are compute-intensive; Colab GPU recommended |
| **Categorical embedding** | Categorical features use learned embeddings (not one-hot) |
| **Learning rate scheduling** | Warmup + cosine decay (standard Transformer practice) |
| **Early stopping** | Prevent overfitting on the smaller rare classes |

We implement TabTransformer in **PyTorch** and train on **Google Colab** GPU.

#### 5.3.5 Multi-Class Output

Like XGBoost, TabTransformer outputs a probability distribution over 10 classes via Softmax. The final prediction is `argmax`.

#### 5.3.6 Why "TabTransformer" and Not a Sequence Transformer?

A common question: "Doesn't a Transformer need sequential data like sentences or time series?"

The answer is **no**. The Transformer was invented for machine translation [11], but its core mechanism — **self-attention** — works on any set of items, ordered or not. The original "Attention Is All You Need" paper processes sequences of words, but we can repurpose it to process a "sequence" of features.

The difference:

| | NLP Transformer | TabTransformer |
|---|---|---|
| **Items** | Words in a sentence | Features in a row |
| **Order** | Word position (meaningful) | Feature index (arbitrary — we add positional encoding anyway) |
| **Purpose** | Understand sentence context | Understand feature interactions |
| **Output** | Next word prediction / classification | Row-level classification |

Think of it like this: if you have 84 measurements from a network flow, a TabTransformer asks "how does each measurement relate to every other measurement?" and uses those relationships to make a prediction. This is especially powerful for intrusion detection, where attacks often manifest as unusual **combinations** of features rather than extreme values in a single feature.

### 5.4 Stacking Ensemble

#### 5.3.1 What Is Stacking?

Stacking is a technique where we combine multiple different models to make better predictions. The idea:

1. Train several different models (the "base models"): XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP
2. Train a small "meta-model" (usually a simple Logistic Regression) that learns how to best combine the predictions from all base models

```
          ┌──────────┐
          │ XGBoost  │────┐
          └──────────┘    │
                          ├──► ┌────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
          ┌──────────┐    │    │ Concatenate│───►│Meta-Model│───► Final Prediction
          │ LightGBM │────┘    │ Predictions│    └──────────┘
          └──────────┘    └──► └────────────┘
                          │
          ┌──────────┐    │
          │   MLP    │────┘
          └──────────┘
```

#### 5.3.2 Why Stacking?

- **Diversity**: Different models make different kinds of mistakes. XGBoost might be great at detecting DoS but bad at Worms. MLP might be better at Worms. The meta-model learns "when to trust which model."
- **Robustness**: Stacking almost always outperforms any single model, though the improvement may be small (0.5–2%).
- **Standard practice**: Stacking won the Netflix Prize and many Kaggle competitions.

#### 5.3.3 Train/Val Split for Stacking

To prevent "data leakage" (the meta-model cheating by seeing the same data the base models trained on), we use **k-fold cross-validation** for stacking:

1. Split training data into 5 folds
2. For each fold: train base models on 4 folds, predict on the 1 held-out fold
3. The out-of-fold predictions become the training data for the meta-model
4. Meta-model learns to combine these predictions

### 5.5 Hybrid Fusion: XGBoost + Transformer (The Complete Architecture)

The full power of our approach comes from **combining** XGBoost and Transformer into a single hybrid model. This is the architecture described in the [System Architecture](#3-system-architecture) section.

#### 5.5.1 Why Go Hybrid?

XGBoost and Transformer have **complementary strengths**:

| Property | XGBoost | Transformer | Hybrid |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Local patterns** (threshold splits) | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Weak | ✅ ✅ |
| **Global feature interactions** | ❌ Limited (tree depth) | ✅ Excellent | ✅ ✅ |
| **Missing values** | ✅ Native | ❌ Requires imputation | ✅ |
| **Inference speed** | ✅ Microseconds | ⚠️ Milliseconds (GPU) | ⚠️ Depends on deployment |
| **Explainability** | ✅ Feature importance, SHAP | ❌ Black-box | ✅ Partial |
| **Rare class handling** | ⚠️ Needs class weights | ⚠️ Needs oversampling | ✅ (diverse signals) |

Each model captures **different signals** from the same data:

- XGBoost captures **individual feature thresholds**: "If `fwd_packets/s > 5000` AND `flow_duration < 0.1`, it's likely DoS."
- Transformer captures **cross-feature relationships**: "The interaction between `packet_length_mean` and `flow_bytes/s` is unusual — this combination is characteristic of an Exploit."

By combining both, we get a more complete picture of the traffic.

#### 5.5.2 Fusion Architecture

```

**How it works**:

1. **Branch A (XGBoost)**: We train XGBoost on the full 84 features. Once trained, we extract an **embedding** from the model. This can be:
   - **Leaf indices**: For each tree, record which leaf a sample lands in. Concatenate all leaf indices → a sparse binary vector representing the model's "decision path."
   - **Tree output before softmax**: The raw logits from XGBoost (10 values, one per class).
   - **Dimensionality-reduced representation**: Use PCA or an autoencoder to compress the leaf-index vector to 64–128 dense dimensions.

2. **Branch B (TabTransformer)**: We train TabTransformer independently (or jointly). We take the **pooled output** from the Transformer encoder (before the MLP head) as our embedding B (128–256 dimensions).

3. **Fusion**: Concatenate embedding A and embedding B.

4. **Fusion MLP**: A small neural network learns how to best combine the two embeddings for the final classification.

#### 5.5.3 Two Training Strategies

**Strategy 1: Two-Stage Training (Recommended)**

| Stage | What Happens | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Stage 1** | Train XGBoost and TabTransformer independently | Each model converges without interference |
| **Stage 2** | Freeze both models. Extract fixed embeddings. Train only the Fusion MLP. | Simple, stable, and fast. The Fusion MLP learns which branch to trust for which classes. |

**Strategy 2: End-to-End Joint Training**

| Stage | What Happens | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Single Stage** | Train XGBoost + Transformer + Fusion MLP simultaneously | Potentially better because the Transformer can adapt to complement XGBoost's weaknesses. But harder to optimize. |

We use **Strategy 1 (Two-Stage)** for its stability and interpretability. Strategy 2 is listed as future work.

#### 5.5.4 Handling the Sequential Structure (Future Enhancement)

While the CIC-UNSW-NB15 dataset is purely tabular, our hybrid architecture naturally extends to **sequential data**. If we later obtain web access logs or group flows by source IP into time-ordered sequences:

- **XGBoost branch** → unchanged (still processes per-flow features)
- **Transformer branch** → extended to process sequences of flows (each timestep = one flow's 84 features)
- **Fusion** → same concatenation + MLP

This means our architecture is **forward-compatible** with richer data sources.

#### 5.5.5 Summary: Why This Hybrid Architecture?

1. **Scientific novelty**: Combining gradient boosting and Transformers on tabular network data is not widely explored in NIDS literature.
2. **Complementary strengths**: XGBoost handles local thresholds; Transformer handles global interactions.
3. **Ablation-ready**: We can compare XGBoost-only vs Transformer-only vs Hybrid to quantify the benefit of each component.
4. **Deployable**: During inference, we can choose to run only XGBoost (fast, CPU) if speed is critical, or the full hybrid for maximum accuracy.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

### 6.1 Accuracy

```
Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)
```

**Simple, but misleading for imbalanced data.**

If 80% of data is Benign, a model that predicts "Benign" for everything achieves 80% accuracy — but it's completely useless. It misses every single attack.

**Our use**: Report accuracy, but do NOT rely on it as the primary metric.

### 6.2 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

These three metrics are computed **per class** and then averaged.

#### For a Single Class (e.g., "Worms"):

| | Predicted: Worms | Predicted: Not Worms |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual: Worms** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual: Not Worms** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP): "Of everything I labeled as Worms, how many were actually Worms?"  
  High precision → few false alarms.
- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN): "Of all actual Worms, how many did I catch?"  
  High recall → few missed attacks.
- **F1-Score** = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall): Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
  Balances both. **This is our primary metric.**

#### Averaging Methods

| Method | How It Works | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Macro F1** | Compute F1 for each class, then average. Every class has equal weight. | When rare classes matter — our main choice |
| **Weighted F1** | Average weighted by the number of samples per class | Gives more weight to Benign (the majority) |
| **Micro F1** | Aggregate TP/FP/FN across all classes | Equivalent to accuracy for multi-class |

**Why Macro F1?** Because "Worms" (0.05% of data) matters just as much as "Benign" (80%). A model that misses all Worms should get a low score.

### 6.3 ROC-AUC

**ROC Curve**: A graph that shows the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate as the classification threshold changes.

- **AUC = 1.0**: Perfect model
- **AUC = 0.5**: Random guessing

For multi-class, we compute **One-vs-Rest ROC-AUC** (one curve per class, comparing that class vs all others).

ROC-AUC tells us: "How well can the model rank examples? Does it assign higher probabilities to correct classes than incorrect ones?"

### 6.4 Confusion Matrix

A matrix where:
- Rows: actual classes
- Columns: predicted classes
- Diagonal: correct predictions
- Off-diagonal: mistakes

```
               Predicted
              Ben  Exp  Fuz  Rec ...
Actual Ben   [350K   2K   1K  ...]
       Exp   [  1K  28K   1K  ...]
       Fuz   [  1K   1K  27K  ...]
       ...
```

A confusion matrix helps us understand **which classes the model confuses**. For example, if the model frequently confuses "Backdoor" with "Exploits," we know those two attack types have similar network patterns.

### 6.5 Inference Latency

For real-time detection, speed matters. We measure:

- **Average prediction time per flow** (microseconds)
- **Throughput**: Flows per second

A target: **< 1 ms per prediction** (to handle high traffic volumes).

---

## 7. Real-Time Deployment

### 7.1 Capturing Live Traffic

Live traffic capture requires **administrative privileges** (root/admin). Methods:

| Method | Tool | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **tcpdump** | `tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap` | Standard, efficient, writes to file | Requires post-processing |
| **pyshark** | Python wrapper for Wireshark/TShark | Python-native, easy integration | Slower, memory-intensive |
| **scapy** | Python packet manipulation library | Very flexible | Slow for high-volume traffic |

**Our recommendation**: Use tcpdump to capture short `.pcap` segments (e.g., 60-second windows), then process with CICFlowMeter. This avoids overloading the CPU with real-time feature extraction.

### 7.2 Extracting Flow Features

We use the Python `cicflowmeter` library, which implements CICFlowMeter in pure Python:

```python
from cicflowmeter import FlowMeter
from scapy.all import rdpcap

# Read packets from pcap
packets = rdpcap("capture.pcap")

# Create flow meter
meter = FlowMeter()

# Process each packet
for pkt in packets:
    meter.process(pkt)

# Get flow features as a DataFrame
flows = meter.flows_to_dataframe()
```

The output is a DataFrame with the same 84 features used during training. This ensures compatibility with the trained model.

**Important preprocessing for live data**: Apply the **same** transformations learned during training:
- Load the saved LabelEncoder for categorical features
- Load the saved StandardScaler parameters
- Apply the same NaN/Inf handling

### 7.3 FastAPI Inference Server

We use **FastAPI**, a modern Python web framework, to serve predictions:

```
POST /predict
  Body: JSON with flow features
  Response: JSON with predicted class, confidence, and per-class probabilities

POST /predict_pcap
  Body: pcap file upload
  Response: List of predictions for each flow in the pcap
```

The server:
1. Receives feature data
2. Applies the same preprocessing as training
3. Runs the trained model
4. Returns the result as JSON

### 7.4 Example API Request & Response

**Request** (individual flow):
```json

## 9. How to Run Everything

### 9.1 Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Huymatip123/Anomaly-detection.git
cd Anomaly-detection

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt** includes:
- `numpy`, `pandas` — data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` — preprocessing, metrics, train/test split
- `xgboost`, `lightgbm` — gradient boosting models
- `torch` — neural networks (install separately for GPU)
- `imbalanced-learn` — SMOTE oversampling
- `fastapi`, `uvicorn` — API server
- `cicflowmeter` — flow extraction from pcap/live traffic
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — visualization
- `jupyter` — notebooks

### 9.2 Preprocessing & Training (Local or Colab)

**Option A: Run Python scripts locally**

```bash
# Step 1: Preprocess
python src/preprocessing/clean.py
python src/preprocessing/encode.py
python src/preprocessing/scale.py
python src/preprocessing/balance.py
python src/preprocessing/split.py

# Step 2: Train models
python src/models/xgboost_model.py
python src/models/mlp_model.py          # Recommended: run on Colab
python src/models/tabtransformer_model.py  # Recommended: run on Colab
python src/models/hybrid_model.py         # Train fusion after individual models
python src/models/ensemble.py

# Step 3: Evaluate
python src/evaluation/compare.py
```

**Option B: Run notebooks on Google Colab (recommended for GPU training)**

1. Upload the `colab/` folder to Google Drive
2. Open `colab/01_eda_and_preprocessing.ipynb` in Colab
3. Run cells sequentially
4. For `02_train_xgboost.ipynb`: runs on CPU (free Colab)
5. For `03_train_mlp.ipynb`: enable GPU runtime (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
6. For `04_train_tabtransformer.ipynb`: enable GPU runtime — Transformer layers need GPU
7. For `05_train_hybrid_fusion.ipynb`: loads pre-trained XGBoost + Transformer embeddings and trains the fusion MLP
8. Download the trained models from Colab to `models_saved/`

### 9.3 Deploy the API

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn src.deployment.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Test with curl
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"flow_duration": 1250000, "fwd_packet_length_max": 1460, ...}'
```

## 10. Results & Discussion

### 10.1 Expected Outcomes

Based on published research using CIC-UNSW-NB15:

| Model | Macro F1 | ROC-AUC | Inference Time |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Random Forest | ~0.75 | ~0.92 | 50 μs |
| XGBoost | ~0.82 | ~0.95 | 30 μs |
| MLP | ~0.78 | ~0.93 | 100 μs (GPU) / 2 ms (CPU) |
| TabTransformer | ~0.83 | ~0.95 | 500 μs (GPU) / 5 ms (CPU) |
| **Hybrid Fusion (XGBoost + Transformer)** | **~0.86** | **~0.97** | **1 ms (GPU) / 5.5 ms (CPU)** |
| Stacking Ensemble | ~0.84 | ~0.96 | 200 μs |

*These are approximate; actual results depend on hyperparameters and preprocessing.*

### 10.2 Model Comparison

We will compare models on:

1. **Overall performance**: Macro F1, Weighted F1, ROC-AUC
2. **Per-class performance**: Which models handle rare classes (Worms, Analysis, Backdoor) best?
3. **Efficiency**: Training time, inference latency, model size
4. **Explainability**: Can we understand why the model makes certain predictions? (XGBoost feature importance vs MLP black-box)

## 11. Future Work

This project is a foundation. Future improvements could include:

### 11.1 Temporal / Sequence Modeling
As discussed in Section 5.5.4, the current TabTransformer processes each flow row independently (features-as-tokens). A natural extension is to reconstruct **flow sequences** by grouping source IPs over time windows. This would allow the Transformer to capture multi-step attack patterns like:
- Reconnaissance → Exploit → Backdoor (intrusion chain)
- Gradual increase in request rate (slow DDoS)

### 11.2 Graph Neural Networks
Represent the network as a graph (computers = nodes, flows = edges). GNNs can learn attack patterns that involve communication patterns between multiple hosts.

### 11.3 BERT for Payload Analysis
If we have access to raw packet payloads (not just flow statistics), a BERT-like model could analyze the actual content of network packets — detecting SQL injection strings, malicious scripts, etc.

### 11.4 Online Learning
Attack patterns evolve. An online learning system would continuously update the model with new traffic data, adapting to new attack types without full retraining.

### 11.5 Self-Supervised Pre-Training
Train a model on unlabeled traffic data (which is abundant) using self-supervised learning, then fine-tune on the labeled dataset. This often improves performance when labeled data is limited.

### 11.6 Adversarial Robustness
Test the model against adversarial attacks (small perturbations to traffic designed to evade detection). This is crucial for real-world deployment where attackers actively try to hide.

### 11.7 Explainable AI (XAI)
Implement SHAP or LIME to provide human-readable explanations for each prediction:
```
Why was this flow flagged as "DoS"?
- Flow Duration: 0.1s (very short) → contributed +0.3 to DoS probability
- Fwd Packets/s: 5000 (extremely high) → contributed +0.4 to DoS probability
- Packet Length Mean: 64 bytes (very small) → contributed +0.2 to DoS probability
```
